# :mushroom: Which ones are safe to eat:mushroom:  - Mid_Term_Project 

## Overview

Train a classification model on a data set of my choice.

## Goals

Determine how well a gill color indicates poisionous

Explore other attributes that offer strong indicators of inedible mushroom

Increase skills using scikit-learn and Python

## Motivation & Background

A professor during my culinary education made a bold proclamation to avoid black gill mushrooms but enjoy purple gill ones. Since then I was curious how accurate this information is. I thought this project could support his claim and or educate me to avoid the right gill colors. Additionally, I am interested in any other attributes that provide a strong indicator of consumability. Most important I want to learn the scikit-learn tool so that I am more proficient building models.
